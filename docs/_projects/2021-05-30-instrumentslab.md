The [Augmented Instruments Laboratory](http://instrumentslab.org) is a research team led by Andrew McPherson within the [Centre for Digital Music](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk) at Queen Mary University of London. Founded in 2011, the lab specialises in designing new digital musical instruments, studying the interaction between performers and instruments, and developing hardware and software tools for creating instruments and interactive audio systems.

The group has received funding from [EPSRC](http://epsrc.ukri.org), [AHRC](http://ahrc.ukri.org), [Innovate UK](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/), the [Royal Academy of Engineering](http://raeng.org.uk) the [OHMI Trust](http://ohmi.org.uk), [CW+](https://www.cwplus.org.uk), [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/instrumentslab/touchkeys-multi-touch-musical-keyboard) and other sources.

The lab has published over 100 [papers](http://instrumentslab.org/publications) and regularly organises [concerts and demos](http://instrumentslab.org/news/), excerpts of which can be found on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/AugmentedInstrumentsLab). The lab also regularly hosts academic visitors and maintains standing collaborations with several companies and charities. The lab's research has led to two spinout companies, [TouchKeys](http://touchkeys.co.uk) and [Bela](http://bela.io).
