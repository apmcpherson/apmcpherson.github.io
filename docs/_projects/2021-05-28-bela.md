[Bela](http://bela.io) is an open-source hardware platform for creating beautifully responsive interactive systems. Following a successful [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/423153472/bela-an-embedded-platform-for-low-latency-interact) in 2016, it spun out into a company [Augmented Instruments Ltd](http://bela.io) which supports a growing community of makers, musicians, artists, engineers and researchers.

Bela originated from the [Hackable Instruments](/project/dbox) research project (EPSRC, 2013-14) and reached its public form through the collective efforts of the [Augmented Instruments Lab](http://instrumentslab.org) from 2014-16.

The Bela hardware consists of an embedded computer (based on the [BeagleBone](http://beagleboard.org) series of open-source boards) with custom hardware for capturing audio and sensor signals. It runs a specialist operating system with several distinctive features:

* Ultra low audio *latency* (input-output delay), as low as 1 millisecond
* Sample-accurate synchronisation between audio and sensor signals
* A built-in browser-based IDE for developing projects
* A flexible browser-based oscilloscope
* Support for C++ and popular music programming languages like Pd, SuperCollider, Csound and FAUST.
* A comprehensive onboard library of example materials

All of the [software and hardware designs](https://github.com/BelaPlatform) are freely available on GitHub. For more information about what Bela does and how to use it, see the [Bela Knowledge Base](http://learn.bela.io).

The [Bela blog](http://blog.bela.io) features projects made by the Bela community. Support is available through the [Knowledge Base](http://learn.bela.io) and [Bela forum](http://forum.bela.io).

Thousands of makers, artists and engineers are using Bela to create new interactivep projects. Bela is also used for teaching in over 20 universities around the world. See the [Bela in education](https://bela.io/education) page for further details on using Bela for teaching and research.

More examples of musical projects made with Bela are featured at the online [Maker Music Festival](https://makermusicfestival.com/building/Oram/).
