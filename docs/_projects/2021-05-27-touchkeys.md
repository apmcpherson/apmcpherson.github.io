[TouchKeys](http://touchkeys.co.uk) is an augmented instrument using capacitive touch sensing to transform the keyboard into an expressive multi-touch control surface. The TouchKeys sensors can be added to the surface of any keyboard, using capacitive touch sensing to measure the location of the musicianâ€™s fingers on the keys during performance.

Following a successful [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/instrumentslab/touchkeys-multi-touch-musical-keyboard) in 2013, TouchKeys spun out into a company, [TouchKeys Instruments Ltd](http://touchkeys.co.uk), which sells kits and instruments to musicians.

## Research

More information on the research behind TouchKeys can be found on the Augmented Instruments Lab [TouchKeys page](http://instrumentslab.org/research/touchkeys.html). The formative research took place in two phases:

1. **Capacitive sensor design.** I tested many configurations and geometries of capacitive sensing to find an approach that allowed fast, accurate sensing on circuit boards shaped to fit each key of the piano keyboard.
2. **Studying keyboard technique.** Playing the piano is already a highly complex task, and any augmentation must be compatible with the years of practice that pianists spend to develop their technique. I analysed pianists' technique to discover how to distinguish intentional movements on the key surfaces from unintentional byproducts of traditional playing.

## Musical Applications

TouchKeys allows the player to flexibly assign different movements to different control parameters of their synthesisers. Example techniques include:

* Shaking the finger side-to-side to perform a vibrato
* Sliding the finger up and down to bend the pitch
* Sliding the finger to control filters and other effects
* Touching the key with a second finger to rapidly restrike a note
* Splitting the keys into multiple regions for microtonal performance
* Emulating nuances of string and wind instruments with subtle movements

Examples of these techniques can be found on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/apm414/videos).
