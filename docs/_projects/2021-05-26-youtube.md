Starting in the March 2020 lockdown, I began producing a series of free video lectures on C++ audio programming using [Bela](/projects/bela). The course now stands at over 20 lectures of 30-60 minutes each. 

The material is based on my teaching at Queen Mary University of London, where I teach a course *Music and Audio Programming* which is a core part of the [MSc in Sound and Music Computing](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/coursefinder/courses/sound-and-music-computing-msc/) and the [PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Music](http://aim.qmul.ac.uk).

Each video lecture features several hands-on activities where the viewer is invited to pause the video and work on a code or hardware exercise, based on [companion materials](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/bela-online-course) freely available on GitHub.
