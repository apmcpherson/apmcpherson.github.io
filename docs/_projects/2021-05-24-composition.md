I completed a PhD in music composition at the University of Pennsylvania in 2009. I have composed 30+ pieces ranging from solo to large ensemble works, a subset of which are listed here. Links to recordings are available for some pieces. Please [contact me](/contact) for scores.

I have also released an album of my music, [Secrets of Antikythera](https://www.innova.mu/albums/andrew-mcpherson/secrets-antikythera), on Innova Music in 2013.
