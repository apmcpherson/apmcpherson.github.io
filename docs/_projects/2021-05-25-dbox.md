The D-Box is a digital musical instrument created in 2014 by [Victor Zappi](https://toomuchidle.com) and Andrew McPherson as part of the EPSRC-funded [Hackable Instruments](http://instrumentslab.org/research/hackable-instruments.html) research project. The project investigated the ways that musicians appropriate, modify and subvert digital technologies for creative purposes. 

To that end, we created the D-Box as an instrument which could be exploratively rewired by the performer using a breadboard concealed inside the instrument. Unlike more familiar modular synths and digital instrument toolkits, the breadboard intentionally did not present a linear, well-formed control space. Instead, feedback loops between hardware and software produce idiosyncratic and unexpected (yet repeatable) results when the circuits are changed. The D-Box was used as a research probe into how performers encounter such opportunities and constraints.

Details on the [research and publications](http://instrumentslab.org/research/hackable-instruments.html) can be found on the Augmented Instruments Lab website. The [design plans](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/d-box) are fully open source.

## Legacy of the D-Box

Aside from the [papers and performances](http://instrumentslab.org/research/hackable-instruments.html) that came from the Hackable Instruments project, the technology behind the D-Box has had an extended influence.

To design the feedback loops between hardware and software, I created an embedded hardware system featuring ultra-low latency processing of audio and sensor signals. This system later proved useful for many other tasks, and it was eventually released to the public as [Bela](/projects/bela). Following a successful [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/423153472/bela-an-embedded-platform-for-low-latency-interact) in 2016, we launched a [spinout company](http://bela.io) to continue growing and diversifying the Bela community.

The D-Box also featured novel capacitive touch sensors on the surface. Several years later, the Bela team turned that technology into a family of touch sensors for makers known as [Trill](http://bela.io/trill). The Trill sensors are easy-to-use modules featuring 1D or 2D sensing of touch position which can be integrated into interactive projects.

Trill launched in a successful [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/423153472/trill-touch-sensing-for-makers) in 2019. Most recently, we have released Trill Flex, a simple, low-cost approach to touch sensing using flexible circuit boards.
