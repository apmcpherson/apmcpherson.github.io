Andrew McPherson is a computing researcher, composer, electronic engineer, and musical instrument designer and a Senior Research Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. He is Professor of Musical Interaction in the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London, where he leads the [Augmented Instruments Laboratory](http://instrumentslab.org). Andrew holds undergraduate degrees in both engineering and music from MIT, an MEng in electrical engineering from MIT, and a PhD in music composition from the University of Pennsylvania. 

Andrew's musical instruments are widely used by performers and composers across many genres, and his research has led to two spinouts: Augmented Instruments Ltd, which develops [Bela](http://bela.io), an open-source audio maker platform, and [TouchKeys](http://touchkeys.co.uk), a transformation of the keyboard into a versatile multi-touch control surface. He is deeply committed to teaching: Bela is used in the classroom by over 20 universities, and his [online course on audio programming](/project/youtube) has been followed by learners around the globe.
